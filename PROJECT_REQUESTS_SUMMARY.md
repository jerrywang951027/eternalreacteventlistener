## 📋 Request History

### Request #1: Platform Events Not Displaying on UI
**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority**: High  

#### Problem Description
- Platform events were not being displayed on the UI despite being received by the server
- Events were visible in console logs but not rendering in the user interface
- WebSocket connection was working but UI wasn't updating

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **React Key Props Issue**: Using array indices as React keys instead of unique identifiers
2. **Event Listener Dependencies**: Socket event listener wasn't properly tied to connection status
3. **Rendering Optimization**: React wasn't detecting changes in the events array properly

#### Solutions Implemented
1. **Fixed React Key Props**:
   ```jsx
   // Before: 
   <div key={index} className="event-card">
   
   // After:
   <div key={event.id || index} className="event-card">
   ```

2. **Enhanced Socket Event Listener**:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     if (socketRef.current && connectionStatus === 'connected') {
       // Event handler setup
     }
   }, [socketRef, connectionStatus]);
   ```

3. **Added Better Debugging**:
   - Enhanced console logging for event flow tracking
   - Added connection status checks
   - Improved event listener lifecycle management

#### Files Modified
- `/client/src/components/PlatformEventsTab.js`

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority**: Medium  

#### Problem Description
- When switching between tabs, all content was lost
- Platform event subscriptions didn't persist
- Received events disappeared when navigating to other tabs
- Had to re-select events and re-subscribe after tab switches

#### Solution Strategy
**State Lifting Pattern**: Move tab-specific state from individual tab components to the parent Dashboard component to ensure persistence across navigation.

#### Solutions Implemented

1. **Lifted Platform Events State to Dashboard**:
   ```jsx
   const [platformEventsState, setPlatformEventsState] = useState({
     events: [],
     platformEvents: [],
     selectedEvents: new Set(),
     subscribed: false,
     loading: false,
     error: ''
   });
   ```

2. **Moved Event Handling to Dashboard**:
   - WebSocket event listener moved to Dashboard level
   - All platform event functions centralized
   - State management unified

3. **Updated Component Architecture**:
   - `Dashboard`: Manages all persistent state
   - `PlatformEventsTab`: Receives state and functions as props
   - Clean separation of concerns
